# PM

My command-line project switcher implementation.

# Goal

Having a simple way to open projects through command-line.

# Installation

```bash
  cd;
  git clone https://github.com/namadnuno/pm
  echo "export PROJECTS='projectname:projectpath,...'" >> .zshrc
  echo "alias pm='python3 ~/pm/main.py'" >> .zshrc # can be .bashrc 
```
